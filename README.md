# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where the goal is to get three of your marks (either "X" or "O") in a row, column, or diagonal on a 3x3 grid. Here's a small description of how it's implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

HTML: The grid is created using a simple structure of div elements. Each cell in the grid is clickable and contains an empty value that will be updated with either "X" or "O" during the game.

CSS: Styling is applied to ensure the grid has clear boundaries and looks appealing. The layout includes a 3x3 grid, with each cell styled to be equal in size, with hover effects and transitions to enhance the user experience.

JavaScript: The game logic is implemented using JavaScript. It detects the player's moves, alternates between "X" and "O", checks for win conditions (three matching marks in a row, column, or diagonal), and displays the winner or a draw. JavaScript also manages restarting the game by resetting the grid.

This project offers a fun way to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic development.
